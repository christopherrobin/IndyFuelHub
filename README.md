# Indy Fuel Hub
Staying up to date with your favorite minor league hockey team isn't always easy. Indy Fuel Hub is a project to create and maintain a set of online tools for monitoring news, roster updates, and more for the Indy Fuel ECHL hockey team.

The genesis release of this project will focus entirely on the Roster feature. The Roster feature automatically retrieves live data for ECHL rosters, filters the data, and displays the manicured results to the user.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) so we'll be using tools like `npm`, `Node.js`, and `React`.

### Installing

Clone a copy of the project locally

```
git clone git@github.com:christopherrobin/IndyFuelHub.git
```

Install the project from the `IndyFuelHub` root directory

```
cd IndyFuelHub
npm i
```

Let 'er rip on `http://localhost:3000/`

```
npm start
```
### Also recommended
`npm test` Launches the test runner
`npm run build` Builds the app for production to the `build` folder
`npm run eject` Don't use this unless you are familiar with `react-create-app` and know what you're doing
